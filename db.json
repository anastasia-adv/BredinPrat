Subsequently, the treasury shares were cancelled in February 2016 which resulted in a reduction of the share capital, the bidder acquired two blocks in July 2016 and the registered office was transferred from Luxemburg to the UK in November 2016. As the bidder owns more than 80%, it will perform a compulsory transfer under English laws of the shares not tendered to the offer.\r\n\r\n* Purchase of 2.45% of the shares on the market between filing and clearance. % owned at clearance: 93.79% of the shares and voting rights\r\n\r\n**At the end of the offer the bidder will initiate a compulsory transfer of the non tendered shares to the majority shareholder as provided or by the articles of association of Target. This procedure is available as the bidder owns more than 80% of the share capital.\r\n\r\n*** Several liquidity mechanisms put in place:\r\n(1) BSAR that can be exercised as from the date of the opening of the offer: put option at the offer price (fixed price)\r\n(2) BSAR that cannot be exercised as from the date of the opening of the offer: two liquidity mechanisms at the election of the holder of the BSAR:\r\n(i)(a) put option at the price determined by an expert ; (b) put and call option in case of a change of control at a price equal to the purchase price of the majority stake\r\n(ii) 3 year extension of the exercisable period of the BSAR and  put and call option in case of a change of control at a price equal to the purchase price of the majority stake\r\nUndertaking from a manager not to exercise its BSAR during the offer period",

According to Euronext rules, delisting may be requested only following a cash tender offer provided that (i) the bidder holds at least 90% of the voting right and (ii) the issuer can demonstrate he very low liquidity. Following a share capital reduction, the family Gattaz concert held 92.17% of the share capital and 95.80% of the voting rights, consequently Target has asked them to file a cash tender offer. Target has undertaken to repurchase the shares that will be bought in connection with the offer so that Bidder may refinance the credit used to acquire the shares. The repurchased shares will be cancelled.\r\n\r\n* Bidder has requested the independent expert to review the fairness of the offer for the shareholders willing to tender as well for those willing to remain shareholder of the company.\r\n\r\n** The offer price has been increased between filing and clearance  \r\n\r\n*** Following a share capital reduction completed in October 2016 prior to the offer.\r\n\r\n",

These purchases were made at the offer price of the initial cash offer (20€). Bidder then filed a repurchase offer followed by a squeeze out (OPR-RO) at a price of 20€ per share. \r\n\r\n",

A fairness opinion (art. 262-1) was delivered to the board prior to issue its recommendation on the OPRA. The main shareholder has undertaken not to tender its shares to the offer. The sale of the significant assets was prior approved by the shareholders in compliance with AMF recommendation n°2015-05. Bidder also distributed dividends in compliance with its SIIC regime. \r\nAs announced, the majority shareholder has subsequently filed an OPR-RO",

Subsequently, Bidder has purchased shares on the market at the price of the 2014 OPR until April 2015, then at a price lower than the offer price between May and August 2015. These purchases enabled him to own 95.30% of the share capital and 97.37% of the voting rights of Target. Therefore the Bidder has filed this OPR-RO at the same price as the 2014 OPR.",

Boussard & Gavaudan (BG) entities invested in Target in December 2014 by subscribing shares with warrants attached (ABSA). The holding in Target have been transferred to the Bidder, part of the BG group, from another BG entity. Mr and Mrs Salik, M. Meeus and Bidder and other BG entities owned warrants (BSA) exercisable until 9 June 2016. They have decided to enter into a shareholders' agreement relating to the exercise of the BSA in order to increase the shareholders' equity and finance the development of Target. The shareholders' agreement qualified as a concert. The concert crossed the 50% threshold which triggered the mandatory filing of a tender offer.\r\n",

As a resulted Bidder increased its shareholding to 94.74% of Target share capital and 96.38% of the voting rights. Thanks to the concert with Mr Brun and Mr Couly, the Bidder was able to file this buy-out offer followed by a squeeze out (OPR-RO).",

To this effect, these shareholders have considered to contribute/sell their Target shares to an SPV, i.e. the Bidder. \r\n\r\n** As a result of the purchases on the market and the acquisition of 1.8% from certain shareholders between filing and clearance, Bidder owned 65.24% of Target prior to clearance. \r\n\r\n*** Bidder did not reach the 95% thresold and could not complete a squeeze out. Target will remain listed until 2017.  Bidder will be bought in 2017 and has filed a new OPAS over Target shares in November 2017.",

      "Comments ": "* Background: Bidder purchased from Bolloré group 59.21% of Target in July 2017 and filed a simplified cash offer (OPAS) in September 2017. Bidder announced that it had no intent to complete a squeeze out. Bidder did not reached the 95% threshold at the end of the offer (offer price 9.25€ per share). \r\nIn October 2017, Bidder accepted an offer to purchase an additional 1.6% of the Target's capital share and owned 96.15% of Target share capital. Subsequently, Bidder considered that the float was not enough to ensure the liquidity of Target shares and announced its intent to file a buy-out offer followed by a squeeze out (OPR-RO) at a price of 9.25€ per share in November 2017. \r\n\r\n",

As a result the concert had to file a mandatory offer. A the end of the offer, the concert owned 86.38% of the share capital of Target, 100% of the convertible bonds and almost all the warrants (BSA). As announced during the initial offer, a share capital increase was subsequently completed (by set off of receivables) which enabled the concert to reach the 95% threshold. In March 2017, the Bidder exercised its convertible bonds. \r\n\r\n* The theoretical value of the BSA was considered as null. The offer price or the BSA was 1€ per lot of BSAs.",

Subsequently, Bidder acquired 0.16% on the market following the 2016 offer and raised its shareholding up to 90.66%. Bidder announced in May 2017 its intent to transform Target SA into a SE and that it was actively reviewing the possibility to transfer the registered office to the Netherlands. Bidder's board also stated that it was favorable to a delisting of Target. Bidder filed a new offer in June 2017 at a price 41% higher than the 2016 offer price. Bidder also obtained an undertaking to tender 5.04% of the share capital to the offer from four shareholders, which ensured the Bidder to reach the 95% squeeze out threshold.\r\n\r\n* Tenders to a simplified tender offer are irrevocable. The Bidder agreed with the four shareholders that the tenders should occur on the first business day following the opening of the offer.",

The 95% threshold was not reached. \r\nBetween June and September 2007, Bidder has acquired shares on the market at an average price of 32.72€.\r\nIn August 2009, following a repurchase offer (OPRA), the Target cancelled 2,535,613 capital shares (9.72% of its share capital) bought at 10.70€ each. As the result of this capital reduction, the Bidder owned 96.75% of Target  share capital and voting rights and filed a buy-out offer followed by a squeeze-out (OPR-RO) (offer price 14€ per share).",

Following the offer in September 2007,  Bidder owned 87.99% of the share capital and 87.60% of the voting rights of the Target. From 02/10/2007 to 07/02/2008,  Bidder  acquired 1.46% of Target share capital. In June 2008, Bidder filed a new tender offer. The offer price of the 2008 OPAS is 3 euros higher than the offer price of the 2007 OPAS.\r\n\r\n* A second independent expert was appointed by the Target to issue a fairness opinion which has been reviewed during the 2nd meeting of the board of directors. This appointment was necessary because of the existence of a common minority shareholder between the Bidder and the first independent expert selected.",

Following this offer, Target  cancelled 176,141 capital shares after a repurchase offer (OPRA) (share buy-back). Bidder  purchased shares on and off the market (including blocks purchases from Banque Santander and Jousse Morillon, Banque de Vizille and Financière de l'Echiquier) and increased its shareholding to 95.31% of Target share capital and voting rights. Therefore, Bidder was enable to file this buy-out offer followed by a squeeze out (OPR-RO). The offer price for this OPR-RO is higher (54€ per share) than the offer price for the OPAS and the OPRA (41.50€ per share)",
